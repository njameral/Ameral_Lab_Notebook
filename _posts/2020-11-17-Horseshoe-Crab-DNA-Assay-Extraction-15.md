## Horseshoe Crab DNA Extraction and Quantification - Qubit Assay Broad Range dsDNA
Date of Extraction: November 17th, 2020\
Date of Assay: November 17th, 2020

Tissue samples extracted: 414-416, 419-422, 424, 497, 498, 787-790, 802-804, 806, 807, 810\
Tissue samples quantified: 414-416, 419-422, 424, 497, 498, 787-790, 802-804, 806, 807, 810

Notes: only added 7ul of DNA to strip tubes because 1ul of DNA added directly to axygen tubes for assay. Accidentally added 10ul sample 371 to strip tube.

DNA Extracted following [Version 3 Extraction Protocol](https://njameral.github.io/Ameral_Lab_Notebook/Horseshoe-Crab-DNA-Extraction-6/)\
Used same assay procedure as in [previous post](https://njameral.github.io/Ameral_Lab_Notebook/Horseshoe-Crab-DNA-Assay/)
