## Horseshoe Crab DNA Extraction with Zymo Quick DNA Miniprep Plus kit
Date Performed: September 2nd, 2020\
Tissue samples processed: 414,442,443,444-2(duplicate),446,859

Processed samples following steps from [previous Extraction Post](https://njameral.github.io/Ameral_Lab_Notebook/Horseshoe-Crab-DNA-Extraction/)

### Notes
I had originally taken out 445, but realized I had done that one previously so I switched it for 859\
444 was also a duplicate, but I accidentally cut the tissue already, this one will be referred to as 444-2
