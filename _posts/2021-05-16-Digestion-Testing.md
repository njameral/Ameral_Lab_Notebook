## Testing Digestion on 12 Samples
Date Performed: May 16th, 2021

Randomly chose 12 samples for digestion:
352,390,391,403,473,786,787,826,854,866,885 (all version 1's, plate labelled "Z")
Started with Step 4 of ddRad Protocol (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iWBGgBZuXlVuiEV-A3ecxeyn9ZaY389tAqGZWksjs5Y/edit)

Followed Bead Clean (1x) protocol
* one mistake during cleaning was that I accidentally left multi-channel set to 90ul for two additions and removals of 80% ethanol (made fresh that day), to correct I just switched multi-channel to 200ul and did two more additions and removals of 80% ethanol

Made fresh PEG-NACL and left on orbital shaker overnight
* 25mL of 5M NaCl solution (use a 5mL pipette for this)
* 10g of Polyethylene gylcol 8000 (use a weigh boat, scooper, and scale by the microwave)
* Nuclease Free water up to 49mL - Realized when writing this up I totally forgot to add this so this PEG-NACL solution is useless
* Invert and vortex a few times, then mix on the orbital shaker for a while to combine

Made master mix of digestion solution
* 136ul cutsmart buffer
* 17ul PST1
* 17ul EcoR1

Added 10ul of master mix to each sample
Pipetted to mix
