## Enzyme Reaction Testing with 250ng DNA
Date Performed: March 23rd, 2021
Samples used: 858,359,854 (randomly selected)
Jon asked to do this test because he was concerned about the apparenty low level of digestion in the previous test. Hypothesized that concentration of large DNA strands meant digestion not complete.

  1. Aliquoted samples following guidance sheet (below)
  2. Followed protocol for 1X bead clean, resuspended in 70ul 10mM tris HCL
  3. While beads were on orbital, made master mix of enzyme solution
  4. After bead clean procedure, added 10ul master mix to each sample
  5. Ran 8 strip tubes of reactions on 12 hour digest in thermocylcer
