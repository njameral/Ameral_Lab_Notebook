## Horseshoe Crab DNA Extraction and Quantification - Qubit Assay Broad Range dsDNA
Date of Extraction: November 5th, 2020\
Date of Assay: November 5th, 2020\
Tissue samples extracted: 412-413, 426-430, 766-768, 811-813, 826-831\
Tissue samples quantified: 412-413, 426-430, 766-768, 811-813, 826,831\
Notes from extraction: messed up when setting up axygen tubes for 829 and 830. Will be run assay at later date.\

DNA Extracted following [Version 3 Extraction Protocol](https://njameral.github.io/Ameral_Lab_Notebook/Horseshoe-Crab-DNA-Extraction-6/)\
Used same assay procedure as in [previous post](https://njameral.github.io/Ameral_Lab_Notebook/Horseshoe-Crab-DNA-Assay/)
