#Horseshoe Crab DNA Extraction with Zymo Quick DNA Miniprep Plus kit
Date Performed: August 21st, 2020
Tissue samples processed: 444,445,491

##Tissue Processing

1. Took 3 samples out of -80 freezer to thaw slowly in ice bucket
2. Labeled 3 1.5mL tubes with "Sample # PBS" and 3 1.5mL tubes with "Sample #"
3. Added 90ul of DI type II water to each of the 3 PBS tubes
4. Added 10ul of PBS solution to each of the 3 PBS tubes
*Above 2 steps create 100ul of 1X PBS solution*
5. Added 300ul of DNA/RNA shield to each of the 1.5mL tubes labeled with "Sample #"
6. Prepared scalpel handle and forceps by cleaning with 10% bleach solution, DI II water, and 70% ethanol solution
*From this step forward this cleaning process will simply be referred to as "cleaning protocol"*
7. Placed new piece of tinfoil on benchtop and put new scalpel blade on handle
8. Removed first sample from tube
9. Carefully cut a small piece of tissue away from exoskeleton
10. Finely chopped piece of tissue into thin transparent layer
11. Placed pea sized amount of tissue into tube labeled with corresponding sample number and "PBS"
12. Placed remainder of tissue back into original collection tube
13. Placed remainder of sample back in -80 freezer
14. Let sample soak for 5-10 minutes while prepping other samples
15. Removed used scalpel blade from handle
16. Repeated steps 5 through 15 for remaining samples
17. After soaking, moved each sample to corresponding tube of DNA/RNA shield
18. Got proteinase K from -20 freezer and put in ice bucket - currently open tube lives in box with samples that have been processed
19. Got blue tissue buffer out of Zymo Quick DNA Miniprep Plus kit
20. Added 150ul of blue tissue buffer to each of the sample tubes
21. Added 15ul of proteinase K to each sample tube
22. Vortexed and centrifuged each sample on countertop machines for ~10 seconds
23. Set thermomixer to 55 C
24. Once warm, put samples in thermomixer at 2:30 PM at 1200 rmp

##Extraction

25. While samples are in thermomixer, set up 3 new 1.5mL tubes with "Sample #"
26. Samples incubated for 1.5 hours
27. Removed samples from thermomixer and centrifuged at 13000rcf for 1 minute
28. Carefully removed supernatant from above pellet in each tube and deposited liquid only into new tube
29. Added 400ul of HCL Tris to 1.5ul tube and labeled "Tris HCL"
*Each sample will need 100ul of Tris HCL so calculate correctly*
