## Horseshoe Crab DNA Extraction with Zymo Quick DNA Miniprep Plus kit
Date Performed: September 12th, 2020\
Tissue samples processed: 447, 448, 449, 450, 452, 453, 454, 455

Processed samples following steps from [previous Extraction Post](https://njameral.github.io/Ameral_Lab_Notebook/Horseshoe-Crab-DNA-Extraction-1/) with a few minor changes:\
  *Skipped PBS soaking step
  *Increased Proteinase K from 15 - 20ul
  *Used less tissue

### Tissue Processing

1. Took 3 samples out of -80 freezer to thaw slowly in ice bucket
2. Labeled 3 1.5mL tubes with "Sample #"
3. Added 90ul of DI type II water to each of the 3 PBS tubes
5. Added 300ul of DNA/RNA shield to each of the 1.5mL tubes labeled with "Sample #"
6. Prepared scalpel handle and forceps by cleaning with 10% bleach solution, DI II water, and 70% ethanol solution
*From this step forward this cleaning process will simply be referred to as "cleaning protocol"*
7. Placed new piece of tinfoil on benchtop and put new scalpel blade on handle
8. Removed first sample from tube
9. Carefully cut a small piece of tissue away from exoskeleton
10. Finely chopped piece of tissue into thin transparent layer
11. Placed half pea sized amount of tissue into tube labeled with corresponding sample number
12. Placed remainder of tissue back into original collection tube
13. Placed remainder of sample back in -80 freezer
14. Removed used scalpel blade from handle
15. Repeated steps 6 through 15 for remaining samples
16. Got proteinase K from -20 freezer and put in ice bucket
17. Got blue tissue buffer out of Zymo Quick DNA Miniprep Plus kit
18. Added 150ul of blue tissue buffer to each of the sample tubes
19. Added 20ul of proteinase K to each sample tube
20. Vortexed and centrifuged each sample on countertop machines for ~10 seconds
21. Set thermomixer to 55 C
22. Once warm, put samples in thermomixer at 2:30 PM at 1200 rmp

### Extraction

23. While samples are in thermomixer, set up 3 new 1.5mL tubes with "Sample #"
24. Samples incubated for 1.5 hours
25. Removed samples from thermomixer and centrifuged at 13000rcf for 1 minute
26. Carefully removed supernatant from above pellet in each tube and deposited liquid only into new tube
27. Added 400ul of HCL Tris to 1.5ul tube and labeled "Tris HCL" and placed in thermomixer on 70 degrees
*Each sample will need 100ul of Tris HCL so calculate correctly*
28. Set up 3 spin columns -yellow tubes- in clear collection tubes -no cap- and labelled with "Sample #"
29. Got "liquid waste" container
30. Added 450ul of Genomic Binding Buffer from Zymo kit to each of the tubes containing samples
31. Vortexed and centrifuged each sample for ~5 seconds
32. Added 700ul of each sample to corresponding spin column set up
33. Centrifuged tubes at 13000rcf for 1 minute
34. Poured liquid that collected in bottom tube into liquid waste and placed yellow spin column back in corresponding tube
35. Removed remaining liquid from sample tubes and placed in corresponding spin column setup
36. Centrifuged tubes at 13000rcf for 1 minute
37. Poured liquid that collected in bottom tube into liquid waste and placed yellow spin column back in corresponding tube
38. Moved yellow columns to new collection tubes and discarded used ones with tips
39. Added 400ul DNA pre-wash from Zymo kit to each collection tube setup
*Labelled DNA pre-was with "Pre" on top to avoid confusion*
40. Centrifuged tubes at 13000rcf for 1 minute
41. Poured liquid that collected in bottom tube into liquid waste and placed yellow spin column back in corresponding tube
42. Added 700ul of DNA Wash Buffer to each spin column
43. Centrifuged tubes at 13000rcf for 1 minute
44. Poured liquid that collected in bottom tube into liquid waste and placed yellow spin column back in corresponding tube
45. Added 200ul of DNA Wash Buffer to each spin column
46. Centrifuged tubes at 13000rcf for 1 minute
47. Poured liquid that collected in bottom tube into liquid waste and placed yellow spin column back in corresponding tube
48. Made 3 new 1.5mL tubes labelled with "sample number, Date, horseshoe crab, DNA, NJA"
49. Moved yellow spin columns to labelled tubes created in last step
50. Discarded remaining liquid waste from collection tubes and discarded collection tubes in tips
51. Added 50ul of warmed 10mM Tris HCL to each tube to incubate for 5 minutes
*Carefully drip liquid directly onto white disc in yellow tube*
52. After incubation, placed samples in centrifuge with all open caps from 1.5mL tubes facing in same direction and spun at max speed for 1 minute
53. Removed samples from centrifuge and added 50ul of warmed 10mM Tris HCL to each tube
54. Let samples incubate for 5 minutes
55. After incubation, placed samples in centrifuge with all open caps from 1.5mL tubes facing in same direction and spun at max speed for 1 minute
56. Removed samples from centrifuge and discarded yellow spin columns in tips
57. Set up freezer box with name, date, lab name, DNA extraction, and box number 1
58. Labelled 3 new tubes from a set of strip tubes with sample numbers
59. Removed 8ul from each 1.5mL samples and placed in corresponding strip tube
60. Placed samples and strip tubes in Box 1 in -20 upright freezer on Puritz shelf
