## Bead Testing on Old and New Beads
Date Performed: May 6th, 2021

Samples selected for testing: 448-2, 438, 779, 877\
Samples from next round of sequencing

* Thawed, vortexed, spun down
* Made two sets of tubes following chart below
![Infographic of bead read]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/bead_test.jpg)
* one is for testing the new beads the other is for testing old beads\

Qubit before clean (after dilution above)
* -N denotes "new" beads, -O denotes "old" beads

Sample | Run 1 | Run 2
---- | ---- | ----
S1   | 196.05 |
S2   | 22448.42 |
448-N  | 26.4 | 26.4
438-N  | 15.9 | 15.4
779-N  | 15.3 | 15.2
877-N  | 29.2 | 28.0
448-O  | 26.6 | 26.2
438-O  | 14.2 | 14.2
779-O  | 14.2 | 14.1
877-O  | 26.0 | 26.8

Followed 1.8X bead clean, only change is cleaned with 150ul ethanol instead of 200ul\
Eluted in 20ul water because I removed 1ul per sample for Qubit

Post Bead Clean Qubit

Sample | Run 1 | Run 2
---- | ---- | ----
S1   | 172.46 |
S2   | 22546.19 |
448-N  | 23.8 | 23.6
438-N  | 11.8 | 11.8
779-N  | 12.7 | 12.6
877-N  | 18.4 | 18.1
448-O  | 20.2 | 20.2
438-O  | 9.10 | 8.98
779-O  | 9.32 | 9.28
877-O  | 14.8 | 14.5

These results didn't look great. Looked like a lot was lost.\
Next I tested three samples by diluting, quantifying, bead cleaning (1.8X), then running in thermocycler.\
Added 2ul cutsmart buffer before putting in thermocylcer  

Sample | Volume for 400ng DNA | Volume up to 21ul Water
---- | ---- | ----
413  | 4.0 | 17.0
440  | 4.0 | 17.0
768  | 4.0 | 17.0

Pre-Thermocylcer Assay

Sample | Run 1 | Run 2
---- | ---- | ----
S1   | 202.64 |
S2   | 24478.58 |
413-O  | 17.8 | 17.2
440-O  | 20.2 | 19.8
768-O  | 13.5 | 10.6
413-N  | 14.9 | 14.8
440-N  | 20.6 | 20.2
768-N  | 11.0 | 16.4
