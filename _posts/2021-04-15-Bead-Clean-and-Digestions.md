## Bead Cleans and Digestions
Dates Performed: April 15th, 20th, 22nd 2021


April 15th, 2021: Bead Clean Plate C
* 1X bead clean (leave beads in!)
* volume=50ul

  Thawed plate C, vortexed and spun
  Made new 80% ethanol
  Followed 1X bead clean protocol (Step 5:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iWBGgBZuXlVuiEV-A3ecxeyn9ZaY389tAqGZWksjs5Y/edit)

April 20th, 2021: Digestion Plate C and Bead Clean Plate B

  Digestion Plate C:
  * Thawed buffer, enzymes (PST1 and EcoR1), and plate c
  * Vortexed and centrifuged
  * Made master mix of buffer and enzymes
  Plate C has 37 samples – n= 37*1.05=39
    Plate C master mix of enzymes
      o	8μl Cutsmart Buffer (10X)  * n = 311
      o	1μl Pst1 * n = 39
      o	1μl EcoR1 * n = 39

      Strip tube setup for plate C for master mix

Number of columns | Volume to Tube

9 | 92
8 | 82

  Followed Step 3 of above protocol.

  Plate B Bead Clean (1X), followed above protocol, Maggie finished and put in fridge

April 22nd, 2021: Bead Clean Plate A and Digestions Plates A and B

  Bead clean plate A, followed steps above

  Digestions plates A and B
  Plates A and B have 74 – n = 74*1.05=78 (n = 156 for both plates)

  Plates A and B master mix of enzymes
  o	8μl Cutsmart Buffer (10X)  * n = 1248
  o	1μl Pst1 * n = 156
  o 1μl EcoR1 * n = 156

  Strip tube setup for plates A and B master mix

*Important Note:*\
For Digestion I did not make enough error margin, had to make more digestion mix for 4 samples\
o	8μl Cutsmart Buffer (10X)  * 4 = 32, 32*1.05 = 33.6\
o	2μl Pst1 * 4 = 8, 8*1.05=8.4\
o 2μl EcoR1 * 4 = 8, 8*1.05=8.4\
Messed up multiplying the amount of digestion enzyme, I thought it was 2ul of each per sample which is how I got 8

*Also Made PEG Solution on 4/22*\
*25mL 5mNACL\
*10g PEG\
*Up to 50ml Nuclease free water\
Shaker to mix, foil, fridge
