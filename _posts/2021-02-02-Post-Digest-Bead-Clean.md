## 1.8X Bead Clean on Digested Samples
Date Performed: February 2nd, 2021

1. Added 144ul Kappa beads to each sample and pipetted up and down to mix (10x)
2. Placed on orbital mixer in magnet plate for 15 minutes on 200
3. Made 80% ethanol mix (5omL conical 40mL 100% ethanol and 10mL nuclease free water)
4. Took samples off mixer
5. Removed clear (~200ul) liquid from each tube and expelled into waste trough
6. Set pipette to ~20ul(this may be off) to carefully suck up any remaining liquid
7. Added 200ul 80% ethanol to each tube on side without bead
8. Removed 200ul 80% ethanol without disturbing bead
9. Added 200ul 80% ethanol to each tube on side without bead
10. Removed 200ul 80% ethanol without disturbing bead
11. Used a p20 to remove any excess ethanol in each tube
12. Waited few minutes for any ethanol to evaporate
13. Took tubes off magnet plate
14. Resuspended beads in 30ul Nuclease free water
15. Put tubes back on shaker
16. Labelled new tubes for cleaned DNA
