I am a Master's student at the University of Rhode Island in the Puritz Lab of Marine Evolutionary Ecology. The research I am conducting is a collaborative effort between the University of Rhode Island and The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. If you have questions about my research, please contact me at njameral@gmail.com.
